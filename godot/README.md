 A game is a **tree** of **nodes** grouped into **scenes**, communicating using **signals**.

- Scene: A reusable collection of nodes (like a blueprint), e.g., a character or level.
- Node: A single object with a function (like Sprite, Camera, etc.).
- Scene Tree: The hierarchy of all active scenes and nodes during gameplay.
- Node Tree: The parent-child structure of nodes inside a single scene.
- Signal: Godot's implementation of [observer pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY_fzd8g5MU)
